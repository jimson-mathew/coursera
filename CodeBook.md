I apologize for this being incomplete. I did not realize the amount of time needed for this. 
I have tried to explain as much as I can discern concerning the meaning of the variables. Thank you for reading the same.
Here it is:

"1" "activity_labels":
The activiy that each participant carries out. This is a factor. Here are the possible values of the activity_labels
  1. WALKING
  2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  4. SITTING
  5. STANDING
  6. LAYING
